# Computer Systems Performance - Project 2
### Parallel Mergesort
* Programming Languages: `C`, `Rust`, `C#`
* Low-Level versus Garbage Collected Langauges
* Compose Hypothesis (Which languages would perform better for X reason?)
* `C#`-specific: Just-In-Time Compilation versus Native Ahead-Of-Time Compulation (JIT vs. AOT)
* We can make reflections on Usability, with LOC being a metric (How many LOC to get the same functionality)
* JIT warm-up and its impact on perfornce; no hot code path
* Metrics: Latency, Number of items sorted per second (perhaps million); Latency of Sort. CPU utilization; Cache misses (a lot of the same as the first project)
* Parameters are important; take inspiration from the fist project; degree of paralleism; Data types (sorting integers versus strings)
* Use threadpools
